Trainable Robotic Arm Created by Robert Svec November 2013

This Arduino based project uses a robotic arm and gripper with the Adafruit analog feedback servos to provide
a robotic arm easy training with a button press and moving the arm with your hands from position to position.

2015 EDIT:
- Code modified to let the arm function with 4 motors instead of 5.
